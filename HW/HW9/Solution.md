We start traversing from root. If both p and q are greater than the root, we move to the right child (because both p and q would be in the right subtree). If both p and q are less than root, we move to the left child (as both would be in the left subtree). If none of these cases apply, it means we have found the Lowest Common Ancestor. This is because now, p is in one subtree and q in another (or one of them is the root).
