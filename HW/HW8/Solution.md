- For a string to be palindrome, all its characters should appear an even number of times in the string except for one character that can occur odd times, which can be the middle character of the palindrome.
- So we can iterate through all the characters of the string, counting the number of times each character appears and keep track of it.
- All the characters that appear even times can contribute fully to the length of the longest palindrome since they can be arranged symmetrically around the center of the palindrome.
- For the characters that appear an odd number of times, say 'n' times, we should add 'n-1' times to the length since we should take the even subset out of these 'n' times for symmetrical arrangement.
- If we encounter any character that appears odd times, we can increment our palindrome length by 1, because this character can be put in the middle of the palindrome and make the palindrome longer.

We utilize a HashMap (in Java) or a Counter (in Python) to achieve this approach. They store characters as keys and their corresponding counts as values. This makes it easier to get the count of each character and handle the characters according to their counts as explained in the approach.
